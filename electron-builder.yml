# "The application id. Used as CFBundleIdentifier for MacOS" — https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#configuration. 
# See CFBundleIdentifier details at developer.apple.com: "Uniquely identifies the bundle. Each distinct app or bundle on the system must have a unique bundle ID. The system uses this string to identify your app in many ways. For example, the preferences system uses this string to identify the app for which a given preference applies; Launch Services uses the bundle identifier to locate an app capable of opening a particular file, using the first app it finds with the given identifier; in iOS, the bundle identifier is used in validating the app’s signature. The bundle ID string must be a uniform type identifier (UTI) that contains only alphanumeric (A-Z,a-z,0-9), hyphen (-), and period (.) characters. The string should also be in reverse-DNS format. For example, if your company’s domain is Ajax.com and you create an app named Hello, you could assign the string com.Ajax.Hello as your app’s bundle identifier." — https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-102070

If you want to rapidly test build, store can reduce build time significantly. maximum doesn’t lead to noticeable size difference, but increase build time." — https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#overridable-per-platform-options
